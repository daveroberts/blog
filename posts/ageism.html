-----
<p>There are quite a few blog posts and writings about ageism in the tech industry.  Generally these articles say: <em>Ageism exists.  It sucks.  I have (or my father has) been fired or not been able to find work after 35/45/55 years old.  The reason given for the fire / no-hire was overly vague: "not a good culture fit" or "you are overqualified".</em></p>
<p>I wanted to write out a few points which I rarely see discussed in those threads:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">1. Ageism claims (usually) can't be disproven</p>
<p>Let's say 55 year old Ed goes for a job interview at ABC company.  He dresses well, feels he answers all of the questions correctly.  A week later Ed gets a form letter: "We've decided not to move forward with a job offer at this time"</p>
<p>Ed is upset, and he's replaying the interview in his mind.  He made no mistakes (that he can remember).  He asks ABC company why he's rejected.  They give a vague non-answer.</p>
<p><em>"This is an obvious case of ageism"</em>, Ed thinks to himself.</p>
<p>Is it?  The answer is no, because Ed is a made-up person.  Just kidding.  The answer is that Ed can claim this is ageism, and we can't prove Ed right or wrong.</p>
<p>When someone is not hired or fired, the employer doesn't (usually) have to give a reason. <a id="footnote-back-1" class="footnote" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>  If the employer gives a reason, they certainly don't have to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Here's a common interview question I would give when conducting interviews: <em>How would you handle a situation where X-Y-Z happens.</em>  Very often, there's no one right answer, but I am looking for certain basics in the answer.  I'm looking for three things:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Correct.  Even when there's no right or wrong answer, there are certain basics that I look for.</li>
  <li>Terse.  Take as long as you need to answer.  But have everything you say be of value.</li>
  <li>Has this candidate <em>actually</em> been in this situation?</li>
</ol>
<p>Too often, the answer would:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Miss some obvious basics.  <strong>"Website is down, what do you do?"</strong>  <em>"Run our unit test suite"</em></li>
<li>Ramble on.  Sometimes candidates think a longer answer is better, and I wonder if they'll ever stop on their own.  Rambling isn't bad as long as hit the basics, but more often than than not, I need to stop the candidate.</li>
  <li>Sounds memorized from a textbook.  There's nothing wrong with a textbook answer, but if I want you to give details, I can tell if you've been there.</li>
</ol>
<p>With open ended questions, you get all sorts of answers.  Some good, some bad, and some terrible.  It's easy to compare one candidate's answers to another's, but it's hard not to be vague when giving feedback to open-ended questions.</p>
<p>After listening to an answer, I move on to the next question.  I don't say "Wrong, you missed a few basics, here's a better answer".  Sometimes the candidate would ask, "Was my answer correct?"  Even then, I wouldn't give feedback.  I would be vague, and say, "I'm just looking to see how you've handled these types of situations before".  The candidate, with the lack of feedback, could be forgiven for assuming their answer was perfectly correct.</p>
<p>After the interview, at least one interviewer was responsible for writing up the hire or no-hire reason.  No interviewer enjoys writing no-hire reasons.  You feel like you're personally putting down a person, even if it's not to their face.  It is easier (and lazier) to write "not enough experience with XYZ systems" than the more concrete and truthful "candidate didn't answer questions well.  Answers were often wrong and not focused and didn't show that the candidate had much experience with XYZ".</p>
<p>Because Ed either gets no response or a vague response, he may correctly assume that the real reason is hidden from him.  However, even if the real reason is hidden, it doesn't mean that ageism is the real reason.  It might be, but Ed will never know. <a id="footnote-back-2" class="footnote" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">2. Ageism can be used as a scapegoat</p>
<p>Let's assume Ed isn't that good of a programmer and knows the interview didn't go well.  Let's also assume that ABC company gave a vague reason like, "Not a good fit".  It might be easier for Ed to believe that he is a victim of ageism, not that he's a below average programmer.  Even if Ed's honest with himself, it might be easier for him to tell his family that ageism was the reason for the no-hire.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">3. Discrimination has a price</p>
<p>If a company is unwilling to hire programmers over 35/45/55, then they are putting themselves at a disadvantage.  Doing so has a cost.  When you artificially lower the supply of programmers, you raise the price.  In other words, assuming ABC is an ageist company, they will have to pay more to hire only younger programmers. <a id="footnote-back-3" class="footnote" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>You may be thinking, <em>"But that's not true, younger programmers work for less money."</em>  In that case, I would suggest that candidate wage was more important than candidate age to the hiring company.  This leads into my final point:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.7em">4. Older programmers make more money</p>
<p>Older people generally make more money than younger people through experience and raises.  Companies almost always ask candidates how much money they make (or how much money they want to make).  A company may prefer to hire lower paid programmers, who also happen to be younger.</p>
<p>Generally older people have more debt and will look at jobs which pay more to help pay off their debt.  They may not be willing or able to accept jobs for under a certain amount of money.</p>
<p>All else being equal, if Ed is looking for a job, but won't consider jobs that pay less than a certain amount, his chances of being hired are lower than a candidate who's willing to work for less money at more companies.</p>
<p>If a company prefers to hire employees who work for less money, is this ageism?  I don't know, but it's not a variable which companies ignore in their hiring decision process.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>My heart goes out to programmers whenever I read about them losing thier jobs.  I'm 35, and I haven't been personally affected by ageism (yet).  However, I hope that the claims of ageism are overstated, and that programmers don't have a natural expiration date, and that I'll be able to work as long as I would like to.</p>

  <h1>Footnotes</h1>
  <div>
    <div><a id="footnote-1" href="#footnote-back-1">[1]</a> At a company where I worked it was required to internally report a reason for no-hire decisions.  I'm not sure if this was a legal requirement, or if the candidate ever saw the reason.  Certain reasons were not allowed or accepted, such as "not a good fit".  You also were not allowed to cite compensation as a reason: "He's good, but not $150K/year good".  You couldn't cite anything that you learned about the candidate that you learned from outside of the interview.  For example, if you talked to a previous co-worker and they told you, "He's not a good worker".</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-2" href="#footnote-back-2">[2]</a> It's usually claimed that ageism is an unconscious bias, so it would be impossible for even the interviewers themselves to know ageism was the root cause if this were true.</div>
    <div><a id="footnote-3" href="#footnote-back-3">[3]</a> The silver lining to ageism is that as long as companies are paying a premium to hire younger programmers, you can hire more experienced programmers for less money.  This applies to any type of discrimination.</div>
