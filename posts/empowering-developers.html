How to empower developers

ios - our way or the highway

developers, developers, developers, developers

rules for a successful platform / language / framework / library

create and deploy a basic application entirely from memory

  starting a new project counterexample
  should be simple.  Sinatra is a great example.  The home page has four lines of code to make a web server.  Many other web servers describe themselves as "sinatra-like".
  complex?  Use a wizard
  config files should reflect what the user specifies
  abstractions leak, not compatible with all the other tutorials on the web (create react app / easy webpack)

be nice to beginners
  be obvious
    the less "magic here" the better
    Let users opt-into functionality.  If generating a new project gives me 800 code files, I'll feel overwhelmed.
  code out of context in tutorials - where do I put this code?
  "but this keeps out the newbies"
  golang project directory

good dependency management
  able to add a new dep easily
    (just about) every npm package has `npm i mypackagename` and code on how to use it
  able to lock deps
  able to distribute in offline env
  there are other properties which good dependency management should have, but these are the properties developers care about

show how to solve real problems

  high level concepts - exercise left to the reader, feels like schoolwork
  go channels - akka - threading libraries - callbacks
  "But this documentation applies to everything!"
  Joel's kermit and miss piggy
  
Examples of "good" platforms / languages, etc are all "blub"  That's okay!
  
should empower developers.  If they aren't able to get started, they're going to feel stupid, and choose something else.
there are exceptions where there's no better competition or you're so far ahead your users are willing to put up with it, but you run the risk of being overturned
