<p>In high school I'd play pickup basketball.  One guy, Ryan, was a beast.  He was tall, athletic, and a great shot.  You wanted him on your team, and you didn't want to defend against him.</p>
<p>One day while playing, I was on a team playing against Ryan.  My teammates were picking who to defend:</p>
<p><i>"I don't want to defend Ryan."</i> said one guy.</p>
<p><i>"Me either."</i> said another.</p>
<p><i>"I'll take Ryan.  I like guarding Ryan"</i> said Alejo.</p>
<p>We all stopped and looked at Alejo like he was crazy.  <em>Nobody</em> liked guarding Ryan.  But he took on the challenge head first.</p>
<p>There's probably some old legacy code in your organization that nobody wants to touch.  When you're assigning stories to the dev team, everyone says, "Not me!".  When I'm new on a team, I'll say, "I want that task."  Just like we all looked at Alejo and thought he was crazy, your team may look at you funny.  However, they'll respect you for taking on the challenge.  Secretly, they'll thank you for saving them from being assigned that task, and be very understanding if you have trouble.  In the future, if there are bugs or enhancements on that section of the code, they'll go to you, and you'll be seen as an invaluable asset to the team.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Where there's muck, there's brass"</p>
