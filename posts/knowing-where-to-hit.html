<p>The legend of the handyman's invoice: A factory machine was broken down, and the factory owner hired a handyman to fix the problem.  The handyman came in, looked at the machinery for about five minutes, and took out a small hammer.  With the small hammer, he tapped one part of the machine once, and everything started working.</p>
<p>The factory owner was delighted and asked the handyman to send him a bill.  The bill arrived and the repair cost $10,0000.</p>
<p>The factory owner was outraged!  "How could five minutes of work cost $10,000â€½  This must be a mistake!"  He wrote a letter to the handyman, "Sir, could you please itemize your bill and resend?"</p>
<p>The handyman sent a second invoice, this time itemized.  It read:</p>
<pre>1. Swinging the hammer - $1
2. Knowing where to swing the hammer to not break the machine - $9,999</pre>

<p>I heard this story back in college and thought it was clever.  However I didn't realize how true it was until I started working.  In many areas, you get out what you put in.  For example, assignments that are harder are worth more points.  The more time you spend studying, the better grades you'll get.  The more money you pay for a product, the better it'll be.  We use this kind of short-hand everywhere because it usually works.</p>
<p>In my mind, the toughest programming assignments <em>must</em> be the ones that will be the most important.  However, in reality, that's not always true.  Maybe just adding another option to a drop down menu is really important.  It could just be a single line of code change.  Almost no effort on your part, but a big impact to the users.</p>
<p>Users simply don't care how many lines of code are behind a feature, they just care about the feature.</p>
