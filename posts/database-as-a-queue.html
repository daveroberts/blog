Rails after_save
Gets slow
Add column status: [Unprocessed, in-process, processed]
Process does select from widgets where status=Unprocessed, process, change to processed
Then that becomes slow, what next
Multiple workers
Round robin, each worker selects one unprocessed item
Work distributor, find everything unprocessed, give to workers when they ask
Or, have the database do it for you
select id from widgets where status=Unprocessed
update widgets, set status="in-process" where id=x and status="Unprocessed"
Will only succeed on one
:-)
