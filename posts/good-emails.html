----
<p>Being able to communicate well is second only to your ability to write good code as a developer.  Here are some of my email tips:</p>
<p><strong>1. Don't document negativity</strong></p>
<p>Emails are forever.  Once you hit send, it's "in the books".  Don't let anger, which is usually a temporary emotion, leak into your emails.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don't be passive aggressive</strong></p>
<p>You may want to side-step point #1 by writing polite emails which are insults in disguise.  For example, <i>"Thank you for finally resolving this"</i>, or <i>"I think you've helped all that you can!"</i>.  Don't do this.</p>
<p><strong>3. Be brief</strong></p>
<p>People don't read emails like a book, from cover to cover.  People skim emails looking for a reason to hit `delete` (or archive).  If you have something important to say in an email, don't bury it in a novel.</p>
<p>Write an email draft and then refine and trim it until the email contains just the bare essentials.</p>
<p><strong>4. If you expect people to take action, make it very clear</strong></p>
<p>When possible, put requests in the first line.  Here's a good example of a concise email <i>"We have developed feature-x and it is ready for testing.  Feature-x allows our software to import Word files.  Jim, can you check out brach-feature-x and test it?  Let us know if it contains bugs or if it is working as expected."</i></p>
<p>As a corollary, if you don't expect anybody to take action, reconsider whether or not you need to send an email.  Sometimes it's necessary to send "No action" emails.  If this is the case and you don't require any action, you can specify, <i>"I have completed step 8 of feature-x.  I expect feature-x will be developed by the end of this week.  At that time I will follow up with an email."</i></p>
