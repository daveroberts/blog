title: "Writing Good Emails"
---

Don't document negativity
Don't be passive aggressive - "Thank you for finally resolving this"
Be as brief as possible
If you expect people to take action, make it very clear
if you don't expect people to take action, reconsider sending an email.
writing good email takes a large amount of time
